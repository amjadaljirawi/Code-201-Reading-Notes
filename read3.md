#### There are three types of HTML lists: ordered,unordered, and definition.
* Ordered lists use numbers.
*  Unordered lists use bullets.
* Definition lists are used to define terminology.
* Lists can be nested inside one another.

# boxs
* CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box.
* You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.
* You can also control the borders, margin and padding for each box with CSS.
* It is possible to hide elements using the display and visibility properties.
* Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and inline boxes made into block-level boxes.

# Decisions and Loops is JS
## loops
* If statements - If a condition is true, then run the code in that block.
* If...Else statements - If a condition is true, then run the code in that block. Otherwise, run the code in the else block.
* For loops - Run the code in this block based on a set number of iteration. This is known.
* While loops - Run the code in this block while a condition is true. The number of iterations is unknown.
## comparison Operators
A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true.
1. (==) - equal to - Compares two items to see if they are equal
2. (!=) - not equal to - Compares two items to see if they are not equal
3. (>) - greater than - Compares the first item to see if it is greater than the second item
4. (<) - less than - Compares the first item to see if it is less than the second item
5. (>=) - greater than or equal to - Compares the first item to see if it is greater than or equal to the second item
6. (<=) - less than or equal to - Compares the first item to see if it is less than or equal to the second item
