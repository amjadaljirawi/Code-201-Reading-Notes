# Forms
* Whenever you want to c XX ollect information from visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a <form> element.
* Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.
* Each form control is given a name, and the text the user types in or the values of the options they select are sent to the server.
 *  HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it easier for visitors to fill in forms.
# lists
  There are several CSS properties that were created to work with specific types of HTML elements, such as lists, tables,and forms.
  * List markers can be given different appearances
using the list-style-type and list-style image
properties.
  * Forms are easier to use if the form controls are
vertically aligned using CSS.
  * In addition to the CSS p XX roperties covered in other
chapters which work with the contents of all elements,
there are several others that are specifically used to
control the appearance of lists, tables, and forms.
  * Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more
interactive.
  # Events
  When you browse the web, your browser registers different
types of events. It's the browser's way of saying, "Hey, this
just happened." Your script can then respond to these events.
  
  * INTERACTIONS CREATE EVENTS 
  * EVENTS TRIGGER CODE 
 * CODE  RESPONDS TO USERS
 
 ---------------
 * Events are the browser's way of indicating when
something has happened (such as when a page has
finished loading or a button has been clicked).
* Binding is the process of stating which event you are
waiting to happen, and which element you are waiting
for that event to happen upon.
* You can use event delegation to monitor for events
that happen on all of the children of an element.
