# HTML Images
Images can improve the design and the appearance of a web page.
* The HTML <img> tag is used to embed an image in a web page.

Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

The <img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.

The <img> tag has two required attributes:

* src - Specifies the path to the image
* alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image

## The src Attribute
* The required src attribute specifies the path (URL) to the image.
## The alt Attribute
* The required alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).
## Image Size - Width and Height
You can use the style attribute to specify the width and height of an image.
