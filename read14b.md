# What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team
#### Team work:-
----------------------------------
* Some time you will not feel that you are a success in your job, that's not because you are less than others, but because it's not the place you deserve to be in.
* Commerce becomes increasingly global and complex, the bulk of modern work is more and more team-based.
* No matter how researchers arranged the data, though, it was almost impossible to find patterns â€” or any evidence that the composition of a team made any difference. 
###### the technology industry is not just one of the fastest growing parts of our economy; it is also increasingly the world’s dominant commercial culture.
