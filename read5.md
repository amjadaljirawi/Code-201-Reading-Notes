# IMAGES
### There are several things to consider when selecting and preparing images for your site, but taking time to get them right will make it look more attractive and professional.
* The <img> element is used to add images to a web page.
###### example
"**(<img src="images/quokka.jpg" alt="A family of
quokka" title="The quokka is an Australian
marsupial that is similar in size to the
domestic cat." />)**"
* You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the content of an image.
* You should save images at the size you will be using them on the web page and in the appropriate format.
* Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.
# COLOR
### Color can really bring your pages to life.
* Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions.
* you can color many things:
1. background-color
2. Foreground Color
* There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:
1. RGB values
2. hex codes
3. and color names.
* Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
# text
* The properties that allow you to control the appearance of text can be split into two groups:
Those that directly affect t 
1. he font and its appearance (including the typeface, whether it is regular, bold or italic, and the size of the text)
2. Those that would have the same effect on text no matter what font you were using (including the color of text and the spacing between words and letters)
* There are properties to control the choice of font, size,weight, style, and spacing.
* If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are several options, but you need to have the right license to use them.
* You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or when they have visited a link.
